# Random Color Generator

I began this project following a webcast from Codecademy, then extended and styled it further on my own.

I replaced a rainbow image with a rainbow gradient background for the header.

I additionally added the ability to see the rgb code for each randomly generated color, making sure to keep the colors separate so as to correspond with the colors in the buttons.
